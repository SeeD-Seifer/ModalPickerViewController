{"name":"Modalpicker","tagline":"A Modal Picker that replaces the ActionSheetDatePicker for Xamarin.iOS","body":"# ModalPickerViewController\r\nThe ModalPickerViewController is a view controller that is designed to replace [ActionSheetDatePicker](http://developer.xamarin.com/recipes/ios/standard_controls/actionsheet/actionsheet_date_picker/).  The ActionSheetDatePicker was an example provided by Xamarin to show a nice looking Date Picker that did not take up the whole screen.\r\n\r\nThough this did do the job, the UIActionSheet was not designed to be subclassed or views added to its hierarchy.  Starting with iOS 7, Apple started issuing runtime warnings, but did not crash the app.  The warnings looked something like this:\r\n\r\n> Error: CGContextSetFillColorWithColor: invalid context 0x0. This is a serious error. \r\n> This application, or a library it uses, is using an invalid context  and is thereby contributing \r\n> to an overall degradation of system stability and reliability. \r\n> This notice is a courtesy: please fix this problem. \r\n> It will become a fatal error in an upcoming update.\r\n\r\nNotice the last two lines of the warning.  Apple was warning developers in iOS 7 that this was not the way the UIActionSheet was intended to be used, and that it will **BREAK** in a future version of iOS.  Well, it now crashes on iOS 8.\r\n\r\n## Example Usage\r\nPlease see the blog post at [http://sharpmobilecode.com](http://sharpmobilecode.com) for example usage\r\n\r\n## Areas For Improvement\r\nWhen you rotate between Portrait and Landscape, the transition is not as smooth as I would like it to be.
